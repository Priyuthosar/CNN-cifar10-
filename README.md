Within Deep Learning, a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of artificial neural network, which is widely used for image/object recognition and classification. Deep Learning thus recognizes objects in an image by using a CNN.


How CNN works in Deep Learning?

Technically, deep learning CNN models to train and test, each input image will pass it through a series of convolution layers with filters (Kernals), Pooling, fully connected layers (FC) and apply Softmax function to classify an object with probabilistic values between 0 and 1.
